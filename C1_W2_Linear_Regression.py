#%% Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
# - You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
# - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
# - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
#     - For these cities, you have the city population.
#     
# Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?
# 
# ## 3 - Dataset
# 
# You will start by loading the dataset for this task. 
# - The `load_data()` function shown below loads the data into variables `x_train` and `y_train`
#   - `x_train` is the population of a city
#   - `y_train` is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.   
#   - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays.

# In[ ]:
# load the dataset
x_train, y_train = load_data()
# In[ ]:
# print x_train
print("Type of x_train:",type(x_train))
print("First five elements of x_train are:\n", x_train[:5]) 
# In[ ]:
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
print("First five elements of y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])  
# In[ ]:
print ('The shape of x_train is:', x_train.shape)
print ('The shape of y_train is: ', y_train.shape)
print ('Number of training examples (m):', len(x_train))

# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to red "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
